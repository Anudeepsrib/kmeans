# kmeans
K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning technique used for grouping similar data points together. The goal of K-means clustering is to partition a given dataset into K clusters where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.

The algorithm works by iteratively assigning data points to the nearest cluster centroid and updating the centroid based on the mean of the data points in the cluster. The process continues until the cluster assignments no longer change or a maximum number of iterations is reached.

The K-means clustering algorithm has several advantages, including its simplicity, efficiency, and scalability to large datasets. It can be used for a wide range of applications, including customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and image segmentation.

However, K-means clustering also has some limitations. One major limitation is that it requires the number of clusters to be specified beforehand, which can be a challenging task for some datasets. In addition, K-means clustering can be sensitive to the initial choice of centroids, which can lead to suboptimal cluster assignments.

To overcome these limitations, variations of the K-means algorithm have been developed, such as hierarchical clustering, fuzzy clustering, and spectral clustering. These variations allow for more flexibility in the number of clusters and can handle non-spherical clusters and overlapping clusters.
